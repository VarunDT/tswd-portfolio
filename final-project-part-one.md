# Final Project Part I: Sports vs. E-sports – Which One Would You Rather Choose to Watch or Play?

## High-Level Summary

This project explores the question: **"Sports vs. E-sports – Which one would you rather choose to watch or play?"**  
This topic resonates deeply with me as it combines two of my favorite activities: playing sports like football, volleyball, and cricket, and enjoying video games. Through this project, I aim to delve into the highs and lows of both traditional sports and e-sports.  

The project provides insights into their growth, audience demographics, lifestyle impacts, professional opportunities, and engagement trends. The objective is to present a balanced and comprehensive perspective, helping the audience determine which aligns better with their preferences and priorities. Using compelling data visualizations and actionable takeaways, the project explores audience interest drivers, the entertainment and participation value of both domains, and their potential coexistence or competition in the future.
