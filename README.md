This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! Here's where I will showcase my coursework and projects, demonstrating my passion for data visualization and storytelling.

# About me
Hi, I am Varun Talreja. I was born in Mumbai, India, and currently reside in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With a natural affinity for numbers and problem-solving, I have pursued roles that leverage these strengths through internships as a Data Analyst, Technology Consultant, Software Engineer and Product Manager. These experiences honed my skills in data analysis, problem-solving, and communication, delivering actionable insights across various projects.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. This aligns with my passion for data-driven exploration and problem-solving. I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering from Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering.

# What I hope to learn
Through this course, I aim to:
1. Master advanced data visualization techniques to communicate insights clearly.
2. Create impactful narratives around complex datasets for different audiences.
3. Experiment with interactive visualizations and develop a public-facing portfolio.
4. Improve my ability to critique visualizations and provide constructive feedback.
5. Apply the lessons learned to projects and client work post-graduation.
