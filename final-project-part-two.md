# Final project Part II: Wireframes / Storyboards and User Research
# New High Level Summary 
Last week, I received feedback that my original topic, comparing sports and e-sports, was too broad and unclear. In response, I narrowed my focus to exclusively cover e-sports. The new topic explores whether e-sports can rival traditional sports by analyzing its growth, audience, accessibility, impacts, and future potential. It traces e-sports’ rise from niche competitions to a billion-dollar industry and highlights key aspects to engage readers and spark interest in playing or watching. The conclusion suggests that e-sports is a strong competitor in the  industry, and that both traditional and digital sports have unique strengths and can coexist. The new High-level summary of the project is as follows:

### Introduction   
- Explore the central question: Can e-sports rival traditional sports?  
- Highlight the project’s goal to analyze e-sports’ growth, appeal, and cultural impact.  
---

### E-sports Timeline  
- Trace the evolution of e-sports from niche competitions to a mainstream global industry.  
- Highlight major milestones, such as the rise of professional leagues, live-streaming platforms, and billion-dollar tournaments.  
- Showcase the key events that shaped e-sports’ rapid growth.  
---

### Growth Over Time (Revenue and Audience)  
- Present data and future predictions on the explosive revenue growth of e-sports, including sponsorships, advertising, and event earnings.  
- Analyze audience size and engagement trends, focusing on global viewership and participation. (Can try to draw comparisions to the sports industry.)
---

### Audience Demographics  
- Examine who engages with e-sports, with breakdowns by age, gender, and geography.  
---

### Physical and Mental Impacts Compared to Sports  
- Compare the physical benefits of traditional sports with the cognitive and strategic advantages of e-sports.  
- Discuss challenges like injuries in sports versus screen fatigue and mental health issues in e-sports.  
---

### Cost and Ease of Playing  
- Compare the costs of participating in e-sports (equipment, internet) versus traditional sports (gear, coaching, infrastructure).  
- Highlight e-sports’ greater global accessibility due to lower barriers to entry.  
---

### Earning Potential  
- Examine earning opportunities in e-sports, such as tournaments, sponsorships, and streaming.
- Includes prize money and viewership data. 
---

### Future Scope/Conclusion  
- Speculate on future trends like VR/AR blending e-sports and traditional sports.  
- Highlight the potential for hybridization and complementary growth between the two.  
- Conclude that both domains offer unique strengths and can coexist, appealing to different preferences and cultural contexts.

# Wireframes / Storyboards
**Link to Shorthand**
The story on Shorthand is a rough demo of what the final project will look like. It is currently incomplete but will be finished before the final presentation next week.

---

# Data Visualizations and Explanations of each section

### E-sports Timeline  
The timeline can be found on the Shorthand link on Page 2. I have highlighted the following years in the timeline as major milestones for the industry:
1972: The First Video Game Competition
1980: Atari’s Space Invaders Championship
1997: The First Modern E-sports Tournament
Early 2000s: Broadband and Growth in tthe Industry
Early 2010s: Streaming and Global Reach
Last 5 Years (2019–2024): Mainstream Recognition
I am currently having problems in editing the photos in the timeline, but it will be resolved by the end of the week

### Growth Over Time (Revenue and Audience)  
**Revenue Growth**: To be highlighted on Pg.3 of Shorthand. Shows present and predicted future growth in the industry.

**Relevance of vizualization**: To show growth rate in the E-sports industry and to show that it is a trend that will stay relevant in the coming few years. 

**Audience Growth**: To be highlighted on Pg.4 of Shorthand. Shows present and predicted future growth of people viewing and playing E-sports.

**Relevance of vizualization**: To show that more and more people are getting interested in watching these digital sports and with the audience comes the backing of sponsors, rise in advertising, and increase in event earnings.

Data Source for both the graphs: **Statista**

On shorthand, I am going to use the scrollpoint feature athat will progress slowly showing the rise in each of the graphs, as shown in one of the sample examples.

### Audience and Player Demographics  
Data for age and gender can be fit in one line and just formatted (Currently as text on shorthand, can play around with color and text size). Data for geography is presented below:

### Physical and Mental Impacts Compared to Sports  
<img width="949" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-27 at 7 04 50 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36a6d99b-ed44-409d-b9ef-e01969f10249">

### Cost and Ease of Playing  
Tabular/Paragraph comparision of the costs for Traditional and E-sports (E-sports costs almost 3 times less than traditional sports). Small paragraph on how esports become popular during pre-covid and covid times due to ease of access and how even the disabled can easily participate. I was planning on doing something like what i had done in Part 1 (as shown below), but it unnecesarily increases the number of charts and also the professor questioned the authenticity of the data in his previous evaluation, hence the idea has been scraped.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff5d0ea9-5c68-413b-a66c-89bc907acf42)
(This area has too much potential, but not enough data is available online. Can ask the users for other ways in which this section can be portrayed)

**Relevance of the past 2 sections**: These 2 sections show how esports helps people and how overdoing it can also cause certain harms(but pros out-weigh the cons and hence one can make an argument of making it an everyday activity). It also reflects how easily esports can become a profession or a household trend unlike traditional sports which requires significant training and equipment cost.

### Earning Potential  
- Examine earning opportunities in e-sports, such as tournaments, sponsorships, and streaming(via viewership).
- Includes prize money and viwership data.

**Relevance of these 2 vizualization**: To show the kind of money that people are already making from E-sports and the vast number of professional players each game already attracts. The second visualization shows that E-sports viewership has already crossed the 5 million benchmark in recent years and hence E-sports streams can easily be monitized and can serve as a source of boosted income and revenue for players and streamers. (Can move viewership in the Groth section based on User feedback, I personally feel it is better in this section).

### Future Scope/Conclusion  
Small paragraph explaining the final argument and photos of AI trends and AR/VR development that can actually help in merging the 2 industries of traditional and digital sports.
