# Final project Part II: Wireframes / Storyboards and User Research
# New High Level Summary 
Last week, I received feedback that my original topic, comparing sports and e-sports, was too broad and unclear. In response, I narrowed my focus to exclusively cover e-sports. The new topic explores whether e-sports can rival traditional sports by analyzing its growth, audience, accessibility, impacts, and future potential. It traces e-sports’ rise from niche competitions to a billion-dollar industry and highlights key aspects to engage readers and spark interest in playing or watching. The conclusion suggests that while e-sports is a strong competitor, both domains have unique strengths and can coexist, inviting reflection on their appeal and cultural impact. The new High-level summary of the project is as follows:

### Introduction   
- Explore the central question: Can e-sports rival traditional sports?  
- Highlight the project’s goal to analyze e-sports’ growth, appeal, and cultural impact.  
---

### E-sports Timeline  
- Trace the evolution of e-sports from niche competitions to a mainstream global industry.  
- Highlight major milestones, such as the rise of professional leagues, live-streaming platforms, and billion-dollar tournaments.  
- Showcase the key events that shaped e-sports’ rapid growth.  
---

### Growth Over Time (Revenue and Audience)  
- Present data and future predictions on the explosive revenue growth of e-sports, including sponsorships, advertising, and event earnings.  
- Analyze audience size and engagement trends, focusing on global viewership and participation.  
---

### Audience Demographics  
- Examine who engages with e-sports, with breakdowns by age, gender, and geography.  
- Highlight the appeal of e-sports among younger, tech-savvy audiences.  
---

### Physical and Mental Impacts Compared to Sports  
- Compare the physical benefits of traditional sports with the cognitive and strategic advantages of e-sports.  
- Discuss challenges like injuries in sports versus screen fatigue and mental health issues in e-sports.  
---

### Cost of Playing  
- Compare the costs of participating in e-sports (equipment, internet) versus traditional sports (gear, coaching, infrastructure).  
- Highlight e-sports’ greater global accessibility due to lower barriers to entry.  
---

### Earning Potential  
- Examine earning opportunities in e-sports, such as tournaments, sponsorships, and streaming.  
---

### Future Scope/Conclusion  
- Speculate on future trends like VR/AR blending e-sports and traditional sports.  
- Highlight the potential for hybridization and complementary growth between the two.  
- Conclude that both domains offer unique strengths and can coexist, appealing to different preferences and cultural contexts.

The story on Shorthand is a rough demo of what the final project will look like. It is currently incomplete but will be finished before the final presentation next week.

# Data Visualizations

### E-sports Timeline  
The timeline can be found on the Shorthand link on Page 2. I have highlighted the following years in the timeline as major milestones for the industry:
1972: The First Video Game Competition
1980: Atari’s Space Invaders Championship
1997: The First Modern E-sports Tournament
Early 2000s: Broadband and Growth in tthe Industry
Early 2010s: Streaming and Global Reach
Last 5 Years (2019–2024): Mainstream Recognition
I am currently having problems in editing the photos in the timeline, but it will be resolved by the end of the week

### Growth Over Time (Revenue and Audience)  
**Revenue Growth**: To be highlighted on Pg.3 of Shorthand. Shows present and predicted future growth in the industry.

Data Source for both the graphs is: **Statista**

On shorthand, I am going to use the scrollpoint feature athat will progress slowly showing the rise in each of the graphs, as shown in one of the sample examples.
