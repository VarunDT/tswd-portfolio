# Redesigning Data Visualizations: A Critique-by-Design Approach
In this project, I followed a structured critique-by-design process to enhance a data visualization through five key steps:

**1. Selecting a Visualization for Redesign:** I chose a visualization from MakeoverMonday that presented opportunities for improvement in clarity and readability.

**2. Critiquing the Original Visualization:** I evaluated the visualization’s strengths and weaknesses, noting issues such as readability, color scheme, clutter, and interpretability. This critique helped me identify specific areas to improve.

**3. Sketching a New Design:** Using the data provided on the visualization’s website and my critique, I created a basic sketch and experimented with different layouts to make the information clearer and more accessible.

**4. Gathering User Feedback:** I shared my sketch with others to assess its clarity compared to the original. Their feedback provided valuable insights, allowing me to refine my design further.

**5. Building the Final Version:** Using Tableau, I developed the final visualization, incorporating feedback to ensure a simple, clear, and effective data story.


## Step one: The Visualization
From the MakeoverMonday website, I selected the following article:

**Source:** [Visual Capitalist - Ranked: The Most Reliable Car Brands in the U.S.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-most-reliable-car-brands-in-the-u-s/)  
**Published by:** Marcus Lu on Visual Capitalist, July 18, 2024  
**Graphic by:** Sam Parker  

**Original Visualization:**
![Most-Dependable-Car-Brands-in-the-US_Web](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bda06976-1dc8-40a1-9586-ee1e55353bf7)

I selected this data visualization because it presents valuable information on vehicle reliability, a crucial consideration for consumers in the U.S. automotive market. The visualization displays a ranking of car brands based on the number of reported issues per 100 vehicles, derived from J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Vehicle Dependability Study. The study collected data from over 30,000 owners of 2021 model-year vehicles, analyzing various problem categories such as exterior, interior, infotainment, and driving experience.

This visualization has potential but could be improved in terms of readability, layout, and data interpretation. I believe that with a few adjustments, the information could be presented more effectively, making it easier for viewers to understand at a glance. This selection aligns with my goal of enhancing clarity and storytelling in data visualizations, particularly by addressing common user experience challenges.

## Step two: The Critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a Solution

## Step four: Test the Solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
