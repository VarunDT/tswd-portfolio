# Redesigning Data Visualizations: A Critique-by-Design Approach
In this project, I followed a structured critique-by-design process to enhance a data visualization through five key steps:

**1. Selecting a Visualization for Redesign:** I chose a visualization from MakeoverMonday that presented opportunities for improvement in clarity and readability.

**2. Critiquing the Original Visualization:** I evaluated the visualization’s strengths and weaknesses, noting issues such as readability, color scheme, clutter, and interpretability. This critique helped me identify specific areas to improve.

**3. Sketching a New Design:** Using the data provided on the visualization’s website and my critique, I created a basic sketch and experimented with different layouts to make the information clearer and more accessible.

**4. Gathering User Feedback:** I shared my sketch with others to assess its clarity compared to the original. Their feedback provided valuable insights, allowing me to refine my design further.

**5. Building the Final Version:** Using Tableau, I developed the final visualization, incorporating feedback to ensure a simple, clear, and effective data story.


## Step one: The Visualization
From the MakeoverMonday website, I selected the following article:

**Source:** [Visual Capitalist - Ranked: The Most Reliable Car Brands in the U.S.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-most-reliable-car-brands-in-the-u-s/)  
**Published by:** Marcus Lu on Visual Capitalist, July 18, 2024

**Original Visualization:**
![Most-Dependable-Car-Brands-in-the-US_Web](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bda06976-1dc8-40a1-9586-ee1e55353bf7)

I selected this data visualization because it presents valuable information on vehicle reliability, a crucial consideration for consumers in the U.S. automotive market. The visualization displays a ranking of car brands based on the number of reported issues per 100 vehicles, derived from J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Vehicle Dependability Study. The study collected data from over 30,000 owners of 2021 model-year vehicles, analyzing various problem categories such as exterior, interior, infotainment, and driving experience.

This visualization has potential but could be improved in terms of readability, layout, and data interpretation. I believe that with a few adjustments, the information could be presented more effectively, making it easier for viewers to understand at a glance. This selection aligns with my goal of enhancing clarity and storytelling in data visualizations, particularly by addressing common user experience challenges.

## Step two: The Critique
This critique applies Stephen Few's "Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile" to analyze and evaluate the visualization. The primary audience includes car buyers, car owners, and automotive industry professionals interested in vehicle reliability, valuing clear, comparable information to make informed choices. The visualization is somewhat effective in delivering quick, at-a-glance insights into the reliability of different car brands, helping viewers gauge brand performance based on "problems per 100 vehicles." Elements that work well include the dark background and bold, white text, which create visual appeal, and the use of brand logos, which makes the visualization relatable and engaging. Numeric values beside each brand support quick understanding of each brand's ranking, while the bar chart format is well-suited for comparison. However, there are areas for improvement: the two-column layout complicates readability by requiring viewers to scan across both columns to grasp the full ranking, which could be simplified by restructuring into a single-column layout. Additionally, the color gradient, though visually engaging, does not correlate directly with reliability scores, and a more intuitive color scheme (such as green for higher reliability and red for lower) could make the data easier to interpret. Adding an industry average benchmark would offer a reference point for better comparison. Overall, this critique-by-design method effectively highlighted the visualization’s strengths and areas for improvement, making it clear that adjustments to layout, color, and comparison features would enhance clarity, usefulness, and engagement for the audience.

## Step three: Sketch a Solution

## Step four: Test the Solution


## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
