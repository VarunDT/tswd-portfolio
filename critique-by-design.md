# Redesigning Data Visualizations: A Critique-by-Design Approach
For this assignment, a 5 step approach was used:
1. Picking a Chart to Redesign: First, I chose a chart that needed improvement. I found this on MakeoverMonday, where people often share visuals that could be clearer or more effective.

2. Critiquing the Visulaisation: I looked at the chart and noted what wasnâ€™t working well, like if it was hard to read, too crowded, or confusing. This helped me understand what needed fixing.

3. Sketching a New Version: Next, I sketched a new version using the data found on the website. This was a quick way to try out ideas, focusing on making the information clearer and easier to follow.

4. Getting Feedback: I showed my sketch to others to see if they understood it better. Their feedback helped me tweak my design to make it even clearer.

5. Creating the Final Version: Finally, I made the finished chart using Tableau. I kept the design simple, making sure the data story was easy to grasp.

## Step one: the visualization

_Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
